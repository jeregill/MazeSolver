# MazeSolver
School Project adapted to be able to solve mazes

Representing a picture as a graph, the solver uses breadth first search of a graph to 
calculate the shortest path between two pixels and subsequently draws the path out. 
Use a simple mathematical comparison of the RGB components of neighbouring pixels 
to determine if they form a valid path through the maze.
